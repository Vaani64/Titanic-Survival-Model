# Titanic-Survival-Model
The Titanic Survival Project uses interactive simulations to explore the RMS Titanic's sinking, allowing participants to experience the conditions and decisions impacting survival. Machine Learning (ML) enhances the project by creating predictive models to analyze factors like socio-economic status and location, improving simulations.
